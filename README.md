### About

This repository contains a **custom interface** built with SwiftUI for Wrapp, an **App Prototype** designed to make long-distance gifting a better experience.
The user can personalize and wrap a digital gift to send, and set a date and time after which it can be opened. Optionally, the receiver can have the gift displayed as a Widget on their deviceâ€™s home screen.
